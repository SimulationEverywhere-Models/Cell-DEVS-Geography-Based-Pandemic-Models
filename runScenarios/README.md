- the json can be manually edited to initialize infection in paticular cell. A pandemic in central Ottawa cell id 35060327 can be initialized with infection after generating the all susceptible JSON, and then the model can be run with this json from the bin folder. The logs for the simulation run will have to be generated manually by running /Scripts/Graph_Generator/graph_generator.py
